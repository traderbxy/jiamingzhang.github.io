excerpt: 'Developed AUP-RLHF, a novel framework integrating user-level label differential privacy (DP) into Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) to protect user preference privacy. Demonstrated that traditional Random Response algorithms perform suboptimally in user-level settings. Proposed a lower bound for user-level DP-RLHF and designed the AUP-RLHF algorithm, achieving ($\varepsilon$,$\delta$)-user-level privacy with improved estimation error.'
