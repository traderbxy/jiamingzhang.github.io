Publications
======
[Towards User-level Private Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback](https://export.arxiv.org/abs/2502.17515)  Submitted to ACL2025
- **Jiaming Zhang**\*, Mingxi Lei\*, Meng Ding, Mengdi Li, Zihang Xiang, Difei Xu, Jinhui Xu, Di Wang
- Developed AUP-RLHF, a novel framework integrating user-level label differential privacy (DP) into Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) to protect user preference privacy. Demonstrated that traditional Random Response algorithms perform suboptimally in user-level settings. Proposed a lower bound for user-level DP-RLHF and designed the AUP-RLHF algorithm, achieving ($\varepsilon$,$\delta$)-user-level privacy with improved estimation error.


[A Case-Based Reasoning Framework for Multi-Hazard Assessment of Earthquake Impacts](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3708/paper_17.pdf)  ICCBR2024
- Yiding Dou\*, **Jiaming Zhang**\*, Yuxin Li, Ruyi Qi, Zimeng Yuan, Yanbing Bai, Erick Mas, Shunichi Koshimura
- Developed an enhanced causal graph Bayesian network integrated with a case-based reasoning framework for multi-hazard impact assessment. This method shows robust adaptability to noisy data and significantly improves accuracy compared to prior models (e.g., USGS). Applied to analyze major earthquakes in Turkey (2023) and Japan (2024), it offers a high-precision, scalable, and unsupervised learning approach for earthquake damage estimation.
